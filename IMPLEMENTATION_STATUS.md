   rm /workspace/smolitux-ui/AGENTS.old2.md
   ```
2. Move the new AGENTS.md.new to AGENTS.md:
   ```bash
   mv /workspace/smolitux-ui/AGENTS.md.new /workspace/smolitux-ui/AGENTS.md
   ```
3. Create package-specific AGENTS.md files for all packages

### Phase 2: Script Reorganization
1. Execute the reorganize-scripts.sh script:
   ```bash
   bash /workspace/smolitux-ui/scripts/reorganize-scripts.sh
   ```
2. Update existing scripts to follow new organization
3. Create remaining utility scripts

### Phase 3: Workflow Streamlining
1. Delete redundant workflow files
2. Update workflow README.md

### Phase 4: Prompt System Completion
1. Create remaining package-specific prompts
2. Create remaining task-specific prompts
3. Create remaining template prompts

## Usage Examples

### Using the Prompt Builder
```bash
node scripts/prompts/prompt-builder.js --base core/system-prompt.md --package core --task component-development --template component
```

### Initializing a Codex Session
```bash
bash scripts/prompts/codex-init.sh --package core --component Button
```

### Generating a Component
```bash
node scripts/generation/component-generator.js --name Button --package core
```

### Validating a Component
```bash
node scripts/validation/component-validator.js --package core --component Button
```

### Tracking Progress
```bash
node scripts/utils/progress-tracker.js --package core --component Button --status complete
```

## Conclusion

The redesign of the Codex agent and script system has made significant progress. The new structure is more modular, maintainable, and efficient. The remaining tasks are well-defined and can be completed in a systematic manner.

The new system provides:
- Clear, consolidated documentation
- Modular, reusable prompts
- Organized, focused scripts
- Streamlined workflows

This redesign will significantly improve the developer experience and enable faster, higher-quality component development across the Smolitux UI library.
