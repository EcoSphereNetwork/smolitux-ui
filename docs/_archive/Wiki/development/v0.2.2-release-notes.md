# Smolitux UI v0.2.2 Release Notes

## Overview

Smolitux UI v0.2.2 is a maintenance release that focuses on improving code quality, fixing bugs, and enhancing the overall stability of the library. This release includes several important fixes for syntax errors and formatting issues that were preventing proper building and testing of the components.

## What's New

- **Code Quality Improvements**: Fixed syntax errors in multiple components
- **Formatting Standardization**: Applied consistent formatting across all files
- **Documentation Updates**: Added comprehensive component test status report
- **Version Bump**: Updated version from 0.2.1 to 0.2.2 in package.json and lerna.json

## Fixed Issues

### Syntax Errors Fixed

- Fixed syntax error in `FormField.tsx` component that was causing build failures
- Fixed syntax error in `ActivityStream.tsx` component that was preventing proper rendering
- Renamed HTML files with `.tsx` extension to `.html` to prevent TypeScript compilation errors

### Formatting Issues Fixed

- Applied consistent formatting to all TypeScript, TSX, JSON, and Markdown files
- Fixed indentation and line endings across the codebase
- Ensured consistent code style using Prettier

## Component Status

A comprehensive test status report has been added to the documentation. This report provides a detailed overview of the test coverage for all components in the library. See [Component Status Report](/docs/wiki/development/component-status.md) for more details.

## Known Issues

- Some components still lack accessibility (A11y) tests
- Jest testing infrastructure needs improvement for better test coverage reporting
- Build process occasionally fails due to dependency issues with tinyglobby and other packages

## Upgrade Guide
