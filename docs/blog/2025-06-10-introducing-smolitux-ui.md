## What is Smolitux-UI?

Smolitux-UI offers a comprehensive collection of reusable UI components. Each component follows modern architecture guidelines and adheres to the WCAG accessibility standards. The documentation in our [Wiki](../wiki/index.md) details the full component list and best practices.

## Key Features

- **Modern Architecture** – modular packages like `core`, `layout` and `theme` provide a flexible foundation.
- **Accessibility** – components are tested against our [A11y Test Plan](../wiki/testing/a11y-test-plan.md).
- **Documentation** – every component is documented with usage examples and guidelines.
- **Sustainable Development** – optimized rendering and a focus on minimal resource usage.

## Architecture Overview

Our monorepo is organized under `packages/@smolitux/` with packages for charts, media, and more. The [Architecture section](../wiki/architecture/architecture-design.md) explains the build process and dependencies in detail.

## Roadmap

Version 0.2.2 introduced a complete component set and improved testing. Upcoming milestones from our [Roadmap](../wiki/development/roadmap-main.md) include expanded accessibility coverage and new features like voice control.
