# Open-Source Licenses

Smolitux UI builds upon many fantastic open‑source projects. These dependencies come with their own licenses. Below is a short overview of the most common license types you will encounter in this repository:

- **MIT License** – A permissive license that allows reuse with attribution. The majority of our dependencies use MIT, and Smolitux UI itself is distributed under the MIT License.
- **Apache License 2.0** – Grants explicit patent rights and permits commercial use with minimal restrictions.
- **BSD 2-Clause and BSD 3-Clause** – Similar to MIT but with additional conditions related to endorsements and attribution.
- **ISC License** – Functionally equivalent to the simplified BSD license.
- **Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0)** – Requires modifications to covered files to remain open source while allowing linking with proprietary code.
