## ðŸ”§ Package Development Workflow

For each package, follow this workflow:

1. **Analysis Phase**
   ```bash
   PACKAGE="core"  # Replace with target package

   # Quick package inspection
   ls packages/@smolitux/$PACKAGE/src/components/
   ```

2. **Component Inventory**
   ```bash
   # List all components
   find packages/@smolitux/$PACKAGE/src/components -type d -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1

   # Check component status
   grep -r "$PACKAGE" COMPONENT_STATUS.md
   ```

3. **Dependency Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Check package dependencies
   cat packages/@smolitux/$PACKAGE/package.json | grep dependencies -A 10
   ```

4. **Implementation Phase**
   ```bash
   # Complete missing components
   bash scripts/workflows/complete-components.sh --package $PACKAGE
   ```

5. **Testing Phase**
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   npm test --workspace=@smolitux/$PACKAGE
   ```

6. **Documentation Phase**
   ```bash
   # Build Storybook
   npm run build-storybook
   ```

7. **Validation Phase**
   ```bash
   # Validate package
   bash scripts/workflows/validate-quality.sh --package $PACKAGE
   ```
