# @smolitux/federation Component Status

This page tracks the progress and quality of the **federation** package. Components enable cross-platform communication via ActivityPub and other federation protocols.

## Component Overview

| Component | Unit Tests | A11y Tests | Integration Tests | Status |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------------|-------|
| ActivityStream | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Needs A11y Tests |
| CrossPlatformShare | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Needs A11y Tests |
| FederatedSearch | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Needs A11y Tests |
| FederationStatus | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Needs A11y Tests |
| PlatformSelector | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Needs A11y Tests |

## Next Steps

1. Implement protocol validation for ActivityPub and custom federation endpoints.
2. Add network error handling tests with mocks for failed requests.
3. Extend Storybook demos with cross-platform examples and protocol scenarios.
4. Ensure all components export strict TypeScript types with no `any` usage.
5. Add accessibility tests for interactive elements.
