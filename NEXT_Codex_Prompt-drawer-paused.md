# NEXT Codex Prompt â€“ Drawer Paused

## Status Summary
- Completed components: Button, Card, Checkbox, Collapse, ColorPicker, DatePicker, Dialog (7/534)
- Drawer implementation aborted due to failing a11y tests and focus management conflicts.

## Next Action
- Refactor shared accessibility helpers and isolate Drawer logic in a sandbox branch.
- Resume component loop once the Drawer foundation is stable.

## Notes
- Lint, build, and Dialog tests currently pass.
- Await refactored Drawer implementation before proceeding to further components.
