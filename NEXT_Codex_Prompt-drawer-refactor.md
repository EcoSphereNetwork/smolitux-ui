## Status
- Drawer UI integration paused
- Working on headless logic module

## Next Steps
1. Implement useDrawerLogic hook with open/close/toggle, placement, overlay, escape, focus flags.
2. Add tests verifying state transitions and escape behavior.
3. Keep Drawer UI files untouched.
4. After logic tests pass and build succeeds, consider integrating UI.
